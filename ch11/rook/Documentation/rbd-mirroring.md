# RBD Mirroring
## Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery (DR) is an organization's ability to react to and recover from an incident that negatively affects business operations.
This plan comprises strategies for minimizing the consequences of a disaster, so an organization can continue to operate â€“ or quickly resume the key operations.
Thus, disaster recovery is one of the aspects of [business continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning).
One of the solutions, to achieve the same, is [RBD mirroring](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rbd/rbd-mirroring/).

## RBD Mirroring

[RBD mirroring](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rbd/rbd-mirroring/)
 is an asynchronous replication of RBD images between multiple Ceph clusters.
 This capability is available in two modes:

* Journal-based: Every write to the RBD image is first recorded
 to the associated journal before modifying the actual image.
 The remote cluster will read from this associated journal and
 replay the updates to its local image.
* Snapshot-based: This mode uses periodically scheduled or
 manually created RBD image mirror-snapshots to replicate
 crash-consistent RBD images between clusters.

## Create RBD Pools

In this section, we create specific RBD pools that are RBD mirroring
 enabled for use with the DR use case.

Execute the following steps on each peer cluster to create mirror
 enabled pools:

* Create a RBD pool that is enabled for mirroring by adding the section
 `spec.mirroring` in the CephBlockPool CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephBlockPool
metadata:
  name: mirroredpool
  namespace: rook-ceph
spec:
  replicated:
    size: 1
  mirroring:
    enabled: true
    mode: image
```

```bash
kubectl create -f pool-mirrored.yaml
```

* Repeat the steps on the peer cluster.

> **NOTE:** Pool name across the cluster peers must be the same
> for RBD replication to function.

See the [CephBlockPool documentation](ceph-pool-crd.md#mirroring) for more details.

> **Note:** It is also feasible to edit existing pools and
> enable them for replication.

## Bootstrap Peers

In order for the rbd-mirror daemon to discover its peer cluster, the
 peer must be registered and a user account must be created.

The following steps enable bootstrapping peers to discover and
 authenticate to each other:

* For Bootstrapping a peer cluster its bootstrap secret is required. To determine the name of the secret that contains the bootstrap secret execute the following command on the remote cluster (cluster-2)

```bash
[cluster-2]$ kubectl get cephblockpool.ceph.rook.io/mirroredpool -n rook-ceph -ojsonpath='{.status.info.rbdMirrorBootstrapPeerSecretName}'
```

Here, `pool-peer-token-mirroredpool` is the desired bootstrap secret name.

* The secret pool-peer-token-mirroredpool contains all the information related to the token and needs to be injected to the peer, to fetch the decoded secret:

```bash
[cluster-2]$ kubectl get secret -n rook-ceph pool-peer-token-mirroredpool -o jsonpath='{.data.token}'|base64 -d
```

> ```bash
>eyJmc2lkIjoiNGQ1YmNiNDAtNDY3YS00OWVkLThjMGEtOWVhOGJkNDY2OTE3IiwiY2xpZW50X2lkIjoicmJkLW1pcnJvci1wZWVyIiwia2V5IjoiQVFDZ3hmZGdxN013R0JBQWZzcUtCaGpZVjJUZDRxVzJYQm5kemc9PSIsIm1vbl9ob3N0IjoiW3YyOjE5Mi4xNjguMzkuMzY6MzMwMCx2MToxOTIuMTY4LjM5LjM2OjY3ODldIn0=
> ```

* With this Decoded value, create a secret on the primary site (cluster-1):

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl -n rook-ceph create secret generic rbd-primary-site-secret --from-literal=token=eyJmc2lkIjoiNGQ1YmNiNDAtNDY3YS00OWVkLThjMGEtOWVhOGJkNDY2OTE3IiwiY2xpZW50X2lkIjoicmJkLW1pcnJvci1wZWVyIiwia2V5IjoiQVFDZ3hmZGdxN013R0JBQWZzcUtCaGpZVjJUZDRxVzJYQm5kemc9PSIsIm1vbl9ob3N0IjoiW3YyOjE5Mi4xNjguMzkuMzY6MzMwMCx2MToxOTIuMTY4LjM5LjM2OjY3ODldIn0= --from-literal=pool=mirroredpool
```

* This completes the bootstrap process for cluster-1 to be peered with cluster-2.
* Repeat the process switching cluster-2 in place of cluster-1, to complete the bootstrap process across both peer clusters.

For more details, refer to the official rbd mirror documentation on
 [how to create a bootstrap peer](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rbd/rbd-mirroring/#bootstrap-peers).

## Configure the RBDMirror Daemon

Replication is handled by the rbd-mirror daemon. The rbd-mirror daemon
 is responsible for pulling image updates from the remote, peer cluster,
 and applying them to image within the local cluster.

Creation of the rbd-mirror daemon(s) is done through the custom resource
 definitions (CRDs), as follows:

* Create mirror.yaml, to deploy the rbd-mirror daemon

```yaml
apiVersion: ceph.rook.io/v1
kind: CephRBDMirror
metadata:
  name: my-rbd-mirror
  namespace: openshift-storage
spec:
  # the number of rbd-mirror daemons to deploy
  count: 1
```

* Create the RBD mirror daemon

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl create -f mirror.yaml -n rook-ceph
```

* Validate if `rbd-mirror` daemon pod is now up

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl get pods -n rook-ceph
```

> ```bash
> rook-ceph-rbd-mirror-a-6985b47c8c-dpv4k  1/1  Running  0  10s
> ```

* Verify that daemon health is OK

```bash
kubectl get cephblockpools.ceph.rook.io mirroredpool -n rook-ceph -o jsonpath='{.status.mirroringStatus.summary}'
```

> ```bash
> {"daemon_health":"OK","health":"OK","image_health":"OK","states":{"replaying":1}}
> ```

* Repeat the above steps on the peer cluster.

 See the [CephRBDMirror CRD](ceph-rbd-mirror-crd.md) for more details on the mirroring settings.


## Add mirroring peer information to RBD pools

Each pool can have its own peer. To add the peer information, patch the already created mirroring enabled pool
to update the CephBlockPool CRD.

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl -n rook-ceph patch cephblockpool mirroredpool --type merge -p '{"spec":{"mirroring":{"peers": {"secretNames": ["rbd-primary-site-secret"]}}}}'
```
## Create VolumeReplication CRDs

Volume Replication Operator follows controller pattern and provides extended
APIs for storage disaster recovery. The extended APIs are provided via Custom
Resource Definition(CRD). Create the VolumeReplication CRDs on all the peer clusters.

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csi-addons/volume-replication-operator/v0.3.0/config/crd/bases/replication.storage.openshift.io_volumereplications.yaml

$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csi-addons/volume-replication-operator/v0.3.0/config/crd/bases/replication.storage.openshift.io_volumereplicationclasses.yaml
```

## Enable CSI Replication Sidecars

To achieve RBD Mirroring, `csi-omap-generator` and `volume-replication`
 containers need to be deployed in the RBD provisioner pods, which are not enabled by default.

* **Omap Generator**: Omap generator is a sidecar container that when
 deployed with the CSI provisioner pod, generates the internal CSI
 omaps between the PV and the RBD image. This is required as static PVs are
 transferred across peer clusters in the DR use case, and hence
 is needed to preserve PVC to storage mappings.

* **Volume Replication Operator**: Volume Replication Operator is a
 kubernetes operator that provides common and reusable APIs for
 storage disaster recovery.
 It is based on [csi-addons/spec](https://github.com/csi-addons/spec)
 specification and can be used by any storage provider.
 For more details, refer to [volume replication operator](https://github.com/csi-addons/volume-replication-operator).

Execute the following steps on each peer cluster to enable the
 OMap generator and Volume Replication sidecars:

* Edit the `rook-ceph-operator-config` configmap and add the
 following configurations

```bash
kubectl edit cm rook-ceph-operator-config -n rook-ceph
```

Add the following properties if not present:

```yaml
data:
  CSI_ENABLE_OMAP_GENERATOR: "true"
  CSI_ENABLE_VOLUME_REPLICATION: "true"
```

* After updating the configmap with those settings, two new sidecars
 should now start automatically in the CSI provisioner pod.
* Repeat the steps on the peer cluster.

## Volume Replication Custom Resources

VolumeReplication CRDs provide support for two custom resources:

* **VolumeReplicationClass**: *VolumeReplicationClass* is a cluster scoped
resource that contains driver related configuration parameters. It holds
the storage admin information required for the volume replication operator.

* **VolumeReplication**: *VolumeReplication* is a namespaced resource that contains references to storage object to be replicated and VolumeReplicationClass
corresponding to the driver providing replication.

> For more information, please refer to the
> [volume-replication-operator](https://github.com/csi-addons/volume-replication-operator).

## Enable mirroring on a PVC

Below guide assumes that we have a PVC (rbd-pvc) in BOUND state; created using
 *StorageClass* with `Retain` reclaimPolicy.

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl get pvc
```

>
> ```bash
> NAME      STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
> rbd-pvc   Bound    pvc-65dc0aac-5e15-4474-90f4-7a3532c621ec   1Gi        RWO            csi-rbd-sc   44s
> ```

### Create a Volume Replication Class CR

In this case, we create a Volume Replication Class on cluster-1

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl apply -f deploy/examples/volume-replication-class.yaml
```

> **Note:** The `schedulingInterval` can be specified in formats of
> minutes, hours or days using suffix `m`,`h` and `d` respectively.
> The optional schedulingStartTime can be specified using the ISO 8601
> time format.

### Create a VolumeReplication CR

* Once VolumeReplicationClass is created, create a Volume Replication for
 the PVC which we intend to replicate to secondary cluster.

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl apply -f deploy/examples/volume-replication.yaml
```

>:memo: *VolumeReplication* is a namespace scoped object. Thus,
> it should be created in the same namespace as of PVC.

### Checking Replication Status

`replicationState` is the state of the volume being referenced.
 Possible values are primary, secondary, and resync.

* `primary` denotes that the volume is primary.
* `secondary` denotes that the volume is secondary.
* `resync` denotes that the volume needs to be resynced.

To check VolumeReplication CR status:

```bash
[cluster-1]$kubectl get volumereplication pvc-volumereplication -oyaml
```

>```yaml
>...
>spec:
>  dataSource:
>    apiGroup: ""
>    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
>    name: rbd-pvc
>  replicationState: primary
>  volumeReplicationClass: rbd-volumereplicationclass
>status:
>  conditions:
>  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-05-04T07:39:00Z"
>    message: ""
>    observedGeneration: 1
>    reason: Promoted
>    status: "True"
>    type: Completed
>  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-05-04T07:39:00Z"
>    message: ""
>    observedGeneration: 1
>    reason: Healthy
>    status: "False"
>    type: Degraded
>  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-05-04T07:39:00Z"
>    message: ""
>    observedGeneration: 1
>    reason: NotResyncing
>    status: "False"
>    type: Resyncing
>  lastCompletionTime: "2021-05-04T07:39:00Z"
>  lastStartTime: "2021-05-04T07:38:59Z"
>  message: volume is marked primary
>  observedGeneration: 1
>  state: Primary
>```

## Backup & Restore

> **NOTE:** To effectively resume operations after a failover/relocation,
> backup of the kubernetes artifacts like deployment, PVC, PV, etc need to be created beforehand by the admin; so that the application can be restored on the peer cluster.

Here, we take a backup of PVC and PV object on one site, so that they can be restored later to the peer cluster.

#### **Take backup on cluster-1**

* Take backup of the PVC `rbd-pvc`

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl  get pvc rbd-pvc -oyaml > pvc-backup.yaml
```

* Take a backup of the PV, corresponding to the PVC

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl get pv/pvc-65dc0aac-5e15-4474-90f4-7a3532c621ec -oyaml > pv_backup.yaml
```

> **Note**: We can also take backup using external tools like **Velero**.
> See [velero documentation](https://velero.io/docs/main/) for more information.

#### **Restore the backup on cluster-2**

* Create storageclass on the secondary cluster

```bash
[cluster-2]$ kubectl create -f examples/rbd/storageclass.yaml
```

* Create VolumeReplicationClass on the secondary cluster

```bash
[cluster-1]$ kubectl apply -f deploy/examples/volume-replication-class.yaml
 ```

> ```bash
> volumereplicationclass.replication.storage.openshift.io/rbd-volumereplicationclass created
> ```

* If Persistent Volumes and Claims are created manually on the secondary cluster,
     remove the `claimRef` on the backed up PV objects in yaml files; so that the
     PV can get bound to the new claim on the secondary cluster.

```yaml
...
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  claimRef:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    name: rbd-pvc
    namespace: default
    resourceVersion: "64252"
    uid: 65dc0aac-5e15-4474-90f4-7a3532c621ec
  csi:
...
```

* Apply the Persistent Volume backup from the primary cluster

```bash
[cluster-2]$ kubectl create -f pv-backup.yaml
```

* Apply the Persistent Volume claim from the restored backup

```bash
[cluster-2]$ kubectl create -f pvc-backup.yaml
```

```bash
[cluster-2]$ kubectl get pvc
```

> ```bash
> NAME      STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
> rbd-pvc   Bound    pvc-65dc0aac-5e15-4474-90f4-7a3532c621ec   1Gi        RWO            rook-ceph-block   44s
> ```
