parameters:
  # nfsCluster is the name of the NFS cluster as managed by Ceph (sometimes called the NFS cluster ID).
  # With Rook, this should get the name of the CephNFS resource.
  nfsCluster: my-nfs

  # server is the host name, ip address, or Kubernetes Service that points to the Ceph NFS server
  # used for mounting the NFS-export.
  # With Rook, a Kubernetes Service named with the pattern "rook-ceph-<name-of-cephnfs>-a" will
  # always be created and can be used here. This is where name-of-cephnfs refers to the name of the
  # CephNFS resource used for nfsCluster above.
  server: rook-ceph-nfs-my-nfs-a

  # clusterID is the Kubernetes namespace where the CephCluster is running
  # If you change this namespace, also change the namespace below where the secret namespaces are defined
  clusterID: rook-ceph # namespace:cluster

  # CephFS filesystem name into which the volume shall be created
  # With Rook, this will be the name of the CephFilesystem resource used to back NFS exports.
  fsName: myfs

  # Ceph pool into which the volume shall be created
  # Required for provisionVolume: "true"
  # With Rook, this will be "<filesystem-name>-<pool-name>" where filesystem-name is the name of the
  # CephFilesystem used in fsName and where pool-name refers to the name of a data pool defined for
  # the CephFilesystem used for fsName above.
  pool: myfs-replicated

  # The secrets contain Ceph admin credentials. These are generated automatically by the Rook
  # operator in the same namespace as the cluster. Note that the NFS provisioner shares its secrets
  # with the CephFS CSI provisioner.
